# GNLP
Short for Garbage NLP. We have NLP tools, and they are garbage.

## Modules

These are the current modules that we made into garbage.

### Fart Stemmer

A Porter Stemmer implementation, but it's garbage.

``` python
In [1]: from fartstemmer import fart

In [2]: fart('the stemmer is very horrible')  
Out[2]: u'the stemmer is verifart horriblfart'
```
